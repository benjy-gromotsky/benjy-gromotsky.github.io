I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton and I plan on graduating in 2027.

## My Favorite Labs From CPSC 120L:

* Lab 1 Part 1:

    I liked this lab because it was a simple yet thorough introduction to the work we would be doing in this class as well as a good hands-on way of starting programming in C++. It was also my first time ever doing the pair-programming system so it was a good way of getting to try out being both the driver and navigator on material that was quite simple rather than being thrown into this new system and being overwhelmed by the material. I learned a lot from this rather quick lab, namely being able to be integrated into Linux programming with C++, learning crucial steps such as cloning the git repository and pushing code to Github, steps which we would continue doing for the remainder of the semester.

* Lab 7, Part 1:

    I really enjoyed this lab because of its practicality to something that I might program in the future in a professional environment. The fact that we were working with assigning different date and time values to the different streets was something that seemed to have a lot of real world application which I liked. When I first started learning computer programming in high school, my father, who is a computer programmer for an insurance company, showed me some of the work he was doing, and I vividly remember him showing me code that he wrote which assigned date and time values to customers who filed claims with his company. Being able to do something familiar with assigning those date and time values while learning the concept of input validation in C++ was definitely a challenge but it was a nice callback to when I first started coding.

* Lab 12, Part 1:

    This was by far my favorite lab overall because it introduced me to so many new concepts, specifically being able to create GIFs using C++. I thought it was really fun being able to work with all the different color values and gradients and being able to see the finished GIF in the end was well worth it. My biggest takeaway that I realized from doing this lab was that there is so much more to showing someone a GIF or video than just pulling it up on Google. Getting to learn how a GIF works on the backend was fascinating to experiment with and having the hands-on experience of creating one via GraphicsMagick is something that helped me further understand color and image processing in C++.
